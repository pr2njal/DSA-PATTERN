# ðŸ“˜ DSA Pattern Repository in C++

Welcome to my DSA Pattern Tracker!  
This repository documents my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms using **C++**, grouped by **patterns under each data structure**.

Recognizing patterns is key to cracking coding interviews efficiently. I'm building this as a reference for both myself and others who want to revise smartly!
